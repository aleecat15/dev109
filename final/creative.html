  <h3><strong>My Trip to Tokyo Disneyland!</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>Tokyo Disneyland</strong></h4>
    <p>When I visited Tokyo a few months ago and went to Tokyo Disneyland, I was expecting it to be like California Disneyland, but I was shocked to find it was so different, in such a good way. To start, the cost of entry and everything in Tokyo Disney was unbelievable less than in California. I was stunned to see so many nice strangers that waved to me when on the rides and when waiting in line. All the rides where so much fun and even better in the US, Japan just makes everything feel better. The overall feeling of the environment was warm and inviting. Tokyo Disney is an absolute must-see place when vising Tokyo!</p>

    <h4><strong>The Cost -</strong></h4>
    <p>When going to Tokyo, Tokyo Disneyland sounded super expensive and at first, I didn’t even look at tickets or the cost of it because I thought it was going to be extremely expensive.  As a huge Disney fan, I couldn’t resist myself and found myself on their website looking at how much tickets cost. After finding the ticket cost, I was amazed that it was almost half of the cost of tickets in the US. I Immediately told my mom, and we got tickets. When we got there, I was shocked to see I was able to get so much more things in Tokyo Disneyland than I could at home because of the cost difference. The cost of souvenirs and food was very reasonable and quite cheap for all we got. It was defiantly a shock from the US prices and would go back in a heartbeat.</p>

    <h4><strong>The Atmosphere -</strong></h4>
    <p>The people in Japan are very welcoming and inviting and love to wave to everyone. I found myself being greeted by very nice strangers. At some points I didn’t even feel like I was a foreigner in another country. The staff were all happy and very respectful and would bend over backwards to help if we needed something. They take their hospitality very seriously. It was quite refreshing to see compared to Disneyland in the US.</p>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>The Rides -</strong></h4>
    <p>My favorite part of this experience was going and seeing the attractions that we don’t have in the US. My favorite ride was the Beauty and the Beast ride because it was so technologically advanced, things would appear and disappear right in front of my eyes without a green screen or animatronics, just like magic. The rides that I was familiar to were even more amazing than in the US. They were incredibly smooth and clean, and they looked almost brand new. They really kept up on their maintenance and kept everything so clean.</p>

    <h4><strong>Conclusion -</strong></h4>
    <p>If you are going to Tokyo, or even anywhere in Japan, you need to go to Tokyo Disneyland. The cost is much lower than I the US and with the great exchange rate it is a no-brainer that you must go. The atmosphere was also great, and the people are incredibly nice. The rides were also fantastic, and I have never felt safer. I had the best time at Tokyo Disneyland, and I think you will too!</p>
